    <p class="pinfo"> I have found my experience of studying the basics of web development, understandable but challenging. As a new coder, I was overwhelmed by the code however, having watched the lectures over again has aided me to improve my understanding of HTML. </p>
        
   <p>Since September, I have gained knowledge in creating a website. I am now capable of creating a basic website with features such as an email box and making my 
    site to a mobile friendly size. I am also capable of inserting images to my site. In order for the presentation of my website to be understandable I inserted columns.</p> 
        
        <p>There have been certain moments whilst learning that I have struggled with such as creating columns. Another thing that I have struggled with is creating the hamburger icon when in mobile friendly size. With regards to creating my hamburger icon I managed to have two lines but inserting the third was hard. I have left my attempted hamburger icon on my home page.</p>
        
        <p>There are many features within the website that are very crucial. One of these the use of appropriate fonts and colours. Within the whole creation of my site, I used times new roman. The reason why is because it is a universal font that can be used on different software. I have also ensured that the colour is user friendly as well as well-presented and professional. </p>
        
        <p>To conclude, overall, I have enjoyed studying web development. Although, I have found it challenging, I still believe that I have learnt a lot and I am ready to expand my knowledge further.</p>
